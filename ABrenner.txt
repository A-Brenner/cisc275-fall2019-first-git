- In your play directory, create four files. Make it so that: one is untracked; one is modified; one is staged; one is in the repo. Verify the state of your four files and ask another person to confirm you have those four files in four states.

In this space, type the sequence of commands you used to achieve the final state of all four files:

touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt
echo "file2 info: name / address ;)" >> file2.txt
git init
git add file2.txt
git add file3.txt
git add file4.txt
echo "hey hi hello this is file3 :)" >> file3.txt
git commit file2.txt -m "file2 with name / address info"
